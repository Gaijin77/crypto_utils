# crypto_utils
Set of my small utils related to cryptography, encoding, decoding etc<br/>
+ morse : decoder/encoder for morse code with option of custom character set<br/>
+ file2png.py: Visualise raw bytes of any given file and saves as a PNG<br/>
+ convert.py: Fetches bytes represented as ASCII strings (hexadecimal, decimal, binary) and converts them into raw binary<br/>
+ dexor.py: XOR file content (starting from a given offset) with a given key<br/>
+ quick_aes: A tiny tool to provide fast AES encryption of strings and files (dedicated for encrypting messages - provides random IV and Base64 encoding of output)<br/>
+ aes_ecb: AES ECB mode - simple encryptor/decryptor<br/>
+ aes_cbc: AES CBC mode - simple encryptor/decryptor<br/>
+ rc4: RC4 encryptor/decryptor<br/>
